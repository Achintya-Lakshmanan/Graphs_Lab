## Overview

random_graph_generate.py -> generate a random graph and stores as random_graph.txt <br/>

run .sh files to compile the code and run the executable

## My approach

Bellman serial -> Update shortest distance to a node if shorter distance is found through another node.

Bellman parallel -> Adjaceny_matrix (min.+) Adjacency_matrix repeatedly.
